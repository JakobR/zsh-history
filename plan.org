#+TITLE: Plan for zsh-history
#+STARTUP: showall

* Subcommand 'merge'
    Merge two histories, optionally dedup as well

    zsh-history merge [--dedup] hist1 hist2 > hist3

* Subcommand 'dedup'
    Remove duplicate commands, keeping the newest instances of each;
    optionally moving the old command into a backup file.

    zsh-history dedup hist1 > hist2
    zsh-history dedup --in-place histfile

* Subcommand 'sort'
    Sort history by timestamp (although UNIX `sort` is probably enough for this).
